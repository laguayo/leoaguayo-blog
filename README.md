My octopress blog check out octopress at [Octopress]("https://github.com/imathis/octopress")

Working on it for a while it can be viewed here [Leo Aguayo]("http://www.leoaguayo.com") I drew some inspiration from Bootstrap and other blogs around. I also managed to upgrade my jekyll to v1.0 using a pull request. [dbldots-pull-1268]("https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/1268") hosted on a free heroku instance :D
