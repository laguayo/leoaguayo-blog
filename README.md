My octopress blog check out octopress at <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a>

Working on it for a while it can be viewed here <a href="http://www.leoaguayo.com">Leo Aguayo</a> I drew some inspiration from Bootstrap and other blogs around. I also managed to upgrade my jekyll to v1.0 using a pull request. <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/1268">dbldots-pull-1268</a> It is deployed on heroku cuz I wanted a bit more control.

I ran into an issue on Heroku where I couldnt run jekyll on start I'll resolve it later so for the mean time I published everything back to public and included it in my git repo, not happy about that.
